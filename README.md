# The Fibonacci Project
Development began on September 24th, 2019 as a little side-project to understand particularly few languages, and draft a report on them that never published. The project initially was abandoned for five months, then February 14th, 2020, I chose to return to this project to include all programming languages as possible. The intention of the project is a library of approximately fifteen to twenty-five languages currently added. I am gradually adding more languages with the aim of a hundred.

The entire project uses the same setup for each language, with only small differences in each. The format being print the first two numbers of the sequence manually, set the two main variables, to finally use a while loop of the key variable being less than one million.
